# My dotfiles

This repository contains some configuration files that I share between computers / installations.

## Installation

Run the `install.sh` script from within the project directory to link all configuration files
to the correct location in your home directory:

* `spacemacs` -> `~/.spacemacs`
* `tmux.conf` -> `~/.tmux.conf`
* `zshrc` -> `~/.zshrc`
