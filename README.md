# My dotfiles

This repository contains some configuration files that I share between computers / installations.

## Installation

Run the `install.sh` script from within the project directory to link all configuration files
to the correct location in your home directory:

* `zshrc` -> `~/.zshrc`
* `zshenv` -> `~/.zshenv`
* `gitconfig` -> `~/.gitconfig`
